Tool for ICMP pinging more than one IP address at a time.

TODO
-  Track when hosts become unresponsive, depending on a certain
   timeout that must be larger than ping interval.
-  Track when a certain proportion of hosts becomes unresponsive,
   i.e. network outage.
-  Use ZeroMQ to deliver results to any requesting clients.
-  Create CMake build, test it works on MSVC 2008 (9) and GCC on
   Ubuntu.

-  Use ZeroMQ to allow more than one masspinger instance to cooperate
   and distribute RTT/visibility results.
