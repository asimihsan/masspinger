Tool for ICMP pinging more than one IP address at a time.

TODO
-  Handle exceptions during startup, crash immediately.
-  Handle exceptions during run that imply loss of network adapter,
   and keep running and send pings at the same rate.
-  Track when a certain proportion of hosts becomes unresponsive,
   i.e. network outage.
-  Use ZeroMQ to deliver results to any requesting clients.
-  Create CMake build, test it works on MSVC 2008 (9) and GCC on
   Ubuntu.

-  Use ZeroMQ to allow more than one masspinger instance to cooperate
   and distribute RTT/visibility results.
