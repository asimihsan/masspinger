Tool for ICMP pinging more than one IP address at a time.

TODO
-  Use ZeroMQ to deliver results to any requesting clients.  Make
   a mock Python client that just plain polling and logs the results.
-  Handle exceptions during startup, crash immediately.
-  Handle exceptions during run that imply loss of network adapter,
   and keep running and send pings at the same rate.  This is almost
   done but we print out "Network is unreachable" too often.
-  Keep a circular buffer of send/receive times with sequence number.
   This should be enough to estimate loss rate and avg/stdev RTT.   
-  Track when a certain proportion of hosts becomes unresponsive,
   i.e. network outage.  Log/note it.
-  Make an Erlang node that tracks historical contactability in
   an Mnesia database.
-  Register a SIP subscriber as a functional, periodic test.  PJSIP
   might work.
-  Register two SIP subscribers, make a call.  PJSIP again.
-  Create CMake build, test it works on MSVC 2008 (9) and GCC on
   Ubuntu.
-  Use ZeroMQ to allow more than one masspinger instance to cooperate
   and distribute RTT/visibility results.
