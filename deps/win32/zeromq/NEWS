0MQ version 2.1.2 (rc2), released on 2011/03/06
===============================================

Bug fixes
---------

* 0MQ now correctly handles durable inproc sockets; previously it ignored
  explicit identities on inproc sockets.

* Various memory leaks were fixed.

* OpenPGM sender/receiver creation fixed.


0MQ version 2.1.1 (rc1), released on 2011/02/23
===============================================

New functionality
-----------------

* New socket option ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX added, allows for exponential
  back-off strategy when reconnecting.

* New socket option ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL_MSEC added, as a fine-grained
  counterpart to ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL (for multicast transports).

* If memory is exhausted, 0MQ warns with an explicit message before
  aborting the process.

Bug fixes
---------

* 0MQ no longer asserts in mailbox.cpp when multiple peers connect with
  the same identity.

* 0MQ no longer asserts when rejecting an oversized message.

* 0MQ no longer asserts in pipe.cpp when the swap fills up.

* zmq_poll now works correctly with an empty poll set.

* Many more.

Building
--------

* 0MQ now builds correctly on CentOS, Debian 6, and SunOS/gcc3.

* Added WithOpenPGM configuration into MSVC builds.

Known issues
------------

* OpenPGM integration is still not fully stable.


0MQ version 2.1.0 (Beta), released on 2010/12/01
================================================

New functionality
-----------------

* New semantics for zmq_close () and zmq_term () ensure that all messages
  are sent before the application terminates. This behaviour may be
  modified using the new ZMQ_LINGER socket option; for further details
  refer to the reference manual.

* The new socket options ZMQ_FD and ZMQ_EVENTS provide a way to integrate
  0MQ sockets into existing poll/event loops.

* Sockets may now be migrated between OS threads, as long as the
  application ensures that a full memory barrier is issued.

* The 0MQ ABI exported by libzmq.so has been formalised; DSO symbol
  visibility is used on supported platforms to ensure that only public ABI
  symbols are exported. The library ABI version has been set to 1.0.0 for
  this release.

* OpenPGM has been updated to version 5.0.92. This version no longer
  depends on GLIB, and integration with 0MQ should be much improved.

* zmq_poll() now honors timeouts precisely, and no longer returns if no
  events are signaled.

* Blocking calls now return EINTR if interrupted by the delivery of a
  signal; this also means that language bindings which previously had
  problems with handling SIGINT/^C should now work correctly.

* The ZMQ_TYPE socket option was added; this allows retrieval of the socket
  type after creation.

* Added a ZMQ_VERSION macro to zmq.h for compile-time API version
  detection.

* The ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL and ZMQ_BACKLOG socket options have been added.

Bug fixes
---------

* Forwarder and streamer devices now handle multi-part messages correctly.

* 0MQ no longer asserts when malformed data is received on the wire.

* 0MQ internal timers now work correctly if the TSC jumps backwards.

* The internal signalling functionality (mailbox) has been improved
  to automatically resize socket buffers on POSIX systems.

* Many more.

Building
--------

* 0MQ now builds correctly with many more non-GCC compilers (Sun Studio,
  Intel ICC, CLang).

* AIX and HP-UX builds should work now.

* FD_SETSIZE has been set to 1024 by default for MSVC builds.

* Windows builds using GCC (MinGW) now work out of the box.

Distribution
------------

* A simple framework for regression tests has been added, along with a few
  basic self-tests. The tests can be run using "make check".
